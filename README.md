# JNDI App using Oracle on Cloud Foundry

## This project shows ways to run Jboss JNDI App using Oracle DB on Cloud Foundry via modified Liberty Build Pack


### Pre-requisites

#### 1. Maven

Spring Boot is compatible with Apache Maven 3.2 or above. If you donâ€™t already have Maven installed you can follow the instructions at maven.apache.org.

On MAC, [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if not already installed. Then install Maven
```
$ brew install maven
```

#### 2. GIT Bash

On Windows, if you don't already have GIT Bash installed, download [GIT Bash here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### 3. Cloud Foundry - PCF Dev or any Cloud Foundry Install

You can run [PCF Dev](https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev) on your local machine following instructions here: https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/introduction

### GET YOUR ENVIRONMENT READY
**Login to PCF (target your CF endpoint, I'm using my PCF Dev URI):**
```
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io
```

**Create User Defined Service:**
Make sure to use **PCF** as your instance name as JNDI will be created using that name. You can use the Oracle URI if you don't have your own Oracle instance:
```
cf cups PCF -p '{"uri":"oracle://admin:management@pcfdb.cizqc6uzdesg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:1521/ORCLPCF?reconnect=true"}'
```

**Clone code:**

``` 
git clone https://github.com/mayureshkrishna/jbossjndi-oracle-liberty-pcf.git
```
Navigate to the cloned directory


### Now you can deploy this to Cloud Foundry 2 ways

## [Option 1: Just "cf push" your WAR file](https://github.com/mayureshkrishna/jbossjndi-oracle-liberty-pcf#option-1-just-cf-push-your-war-file-1)
## [Option 2: "cf push" websphere/liberty SERVER directory](https://github.com/mayureshkrishna/jbossjndi-oracle-liberty-pcf#option-2-cf-push-websphereliberty-server-directory)


### Option 1: Just "cf push" your WAR file

**Package code using maven:**
Go to your cloned code root directory and run
```
mvn clean package
```
**Push code to Cloud Foundry:**
*Make sure you are running this from your cloned code root directory*
```
cf push -b https://github.com/mayureshkrishna/ibm-websphere-liberty-buildpack.git -p target/HibernateJndi.war HibernateJndi
```

**Bind Service to App:**
Bind the Oracle User Defined service which your created earlier to the app you just pushed.

```
cf bind-service HibernateJndi PCF
```
Make sure to restage the app so that auto configuration of JNDI picks up.

```
cf restage HibernateJndi
```

Here's the restage logs and you will notice the Autowiring:

***-----> Auto-configuration is creating config for service instance 'PCF' of type 'oracle'***

```

``` 

### Option 2: "cf push" your websphere/liberty SERVER directory

Make sure you are at the cloned root directory

```
MK:jbossjndi-oracle-liberty-pcf mkrishna$ ls

LICENSE  README.md  WebContent  manifest.yml  pcfliberty  pom.xml  src  target
```
You will notice there's pcfliberty directory here, which is essentially websphere/liberty server directory. There is no use of this directory in the previous option. 

We will use this pre-configured server directory which has the built "WAR" file of the app as well.

*P.S.: In this option you can change the **server.xml** as per your need and all you have to do is copy your packaged **"WAR"** file to **"apps"** directory under the server directory.*

Let's move the manifest file from pcfliberty directory to root so that we can exclude server.xml updates via auto-configuration.
```
mv pcfliberty/manifest.yml .
```

If you look at manifest.yml, it has additional exclude parameter.
```
MK:jbossjndi-oracle-liberty-pcf mkrishna$ cat manifest.yml
---
env:
  IBM_JVM_LICENSE: L-PMAA-A3Z8P2
  IBM_LIBERTY_LICENSE: L-CTUR-AVDTCN
  services_autoconfig_excludes: oracle=config
```

Now let's just **"cf push"** it.
*Make sure you are running this from your cloned code root directory*
```
cf push -b https://github.com/mayureshkrishna/ibm-websphere-liberty-buildpack.git -p pcfliberty/ HibernateJndi
```

**Bind Service to App:**
Bind the Oracle User Defined service which your created earlier to the app you just pushed.

```
cf bind-service HibernateJndi PCF
```
Make sure to restage the app so that auto configuration of JNDI picks up.

```
cf restage HibernateJndi
```
In the restage logs and you will notice the Autowiring:

***-----> Auto-configuration is creating config for service instance 'PCF' of type 'oracle'***
